      abstract = {Sparse ridge regression is widely utilized in modern data analysis and machine learning. 
                  However, computing globally optimal solutions for sparse ridge regression is challenging, 
                  particularly when samples are arbitrarily given or generated under weak modeling assumptions. 
                  This paper proposes a novel cut-generation method, Screening Cut Generation (SCG), to eliminate 
                  non-optimal solutions for arbitrarily given samples. In contrast to recent safe variable screening 
                  approaches, SCG offers superior screening capability by identifying whether a specific {Â±1} combination 
                  of multiple features (binaries) lies in the set of optimal solutions. This identification is based on 
                  a convex relaxation solution rather than directly solving the original sparse ridge regression. Hence, 
                  the cuts generated by SCG can be applied in the pre-processing step of branch-and-bound and its variants 
                  to construct safe outer approximations of the optimal solution set. Numerical experiments are reported 
                  to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of SCG, particularly in hard real 
                  instances and synthetic instances with high dimensions, low ridge regularization parameters, or challenging modeling assumptions.},
